MyAssignment

#Exercise 2- Create a markdown cell with the title of the notebook.

Data Science Tools and Ecosystem

#Exercise 3 - Create a markdown cell for an introduction.

In this notebook, Data Science Tools and Ecosystem are summarized.

Objectives: 1.List popular languages that Data Scientists use. 2.List commonly used libraries used by Data Scientists. 3.Comment on Data Science tools.

#Exercise 4 - Create a markdown cell to list data science languages. (3 pts)

Some of the popular languages that Data Scientists use are: Python SQL. Java. Julia. Scala. C/C++. JavaScript.

#Exercise 5 - Create a markdown cell to list data science libraries.

Some of the commonly used libraries used by Data Scientists include:

TensorFlow. NumPy. SciPy. Pandas. Matplotlib. Keras. SciKit-Learn. PyTorch. Scrapy. BeautifulSoup. LightGBM. ELI5. Theano. NuPIC. Ramp. Pipenv. Bob. PyBrain. Caffe2. Chainer.

#Exercise 6 - Create a markdown cell with a table of Data Science tools.

Data Science Tools SAS: It is one of those data science tools which are specifically designed for statistical operation Apache Spark BigML

Exercise 7 - Create a markdown cell introducing arithmetic expression examples
# Arithmetic operations
code = compile("5 + 4", "<string>", "eval")
eval(code)
# Result: 9

code1 = compile("(5 + 7) * 2", "<string>", "eval")
eval(code1)
# Result: 24

import math
# Volume of a sphere
code2 = compile("4 / 3 * math.pi * math.pow(25, 3)", "<string>", "eval")
eval(code2)
# Result: 65449.84694978735

Exercise 8 - Create a code cell to multiply and add numbers This a simple arithmetic expression to mutiply then add integers

(3*4)+5
# Result: 17

Exercise 9 - Create a code cell to convert minutes to hours. (2 pts)

This will convert 200 minutes to hours by diving by 60

days = 0
hours = 0
mins = 0

time = 200
#days = time / 1440
leftover_minutes = time % 1440
hours = leftover_minutes / 60
#mins = time - (days*1440) - (hours*60)
print(str(days) + " days, " + str(hours) + " hours, " + str(mins) +  " mins. ")

# Result: 3.3333333333333335 hours

#Exercise 10 -Insert a markdown cell to list Objectives.

Below the introduction cell created in Exercise 3, insert a new markdown cell to list the objectives that this notebook covered (i.e. some of the key takeaways from the course). In this new cell start with an introductory line titled: Objectives: in bold font. Then using an unordered list (bullets) indicate 3 to 5 items covered in this notebook, such as List popular languages for Data Science.

#Exercise 11 - Create a markdown cell to indicate the Authorâ€™s name
